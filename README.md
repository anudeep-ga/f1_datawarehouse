## Problem Setting

Formula 1, the pinnacle of motorsport, is a realm where speed, precision, and innovation
converge. With a storied history dating back decades, it captivates a global audience,
transforming drivers into legends and teams into engineering powerhouses. Yet, beneath the
excitement of roaring engines lies a colossal data challenge. Each race generates a torrent of
data, from car telemetry and driver performance metrics to real-time weather conditions and
fan interactions across digital platforms. Managing this data influx effectively is the linchpin for
revolutionizing Formula 1.


## Problem Definition

The problem at hand revolves around the Formula 1 ecosystem, where an escalating influx of
diverse data from sources like race telemetry, car sensors, driver metrics, weather conditions,
and fan interactions presents a pressing challenge. This challenge entails designing a
comprehensive solution for efficient data collection, processing, and real-time analysis. The
overarching goal is to leverage this wealth of information to optimize race strategies, enhance
vehicle development, and enrich fan engagement. Moreover, the project faces the formidable
task of managing high-speed data streams during races, while simultaneously prioritizing data
security and privacy. In summary, the problem definition centers on orchestrating effective
data management in Formula 1 to usher in a data-driven era that revolutionizes the sport's
performance and fan experience.
